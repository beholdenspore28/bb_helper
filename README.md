# lite-lib
What is this and why have you created it?

  This project is a general purpose tool library for tasks I believe to be 
common in software development. lite-lib is written in C89. I realise that no 
one asked for this and there is probably someone out there who has already done 
what I am trying to do here. The main goal for me is to learn the 
inner-workings of the code most people take for granted. This will allow me to 
completely understand all of the code that I use in my projects.

How do I use it?

All questions will be answered when you look at lite_lib.h

Why is it called lite_lib?

This is a library that will eventually make up a large portion of my game engine "Lite-Engine"
