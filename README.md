# blib
What is this and why have you created it?

  This project is a general purpose tool library for tasks I believe to be 
common in software development. blib is written in C89. I realise that no 
one asked for this and there is probably someone out there who has already done 
what I am trying to do here. The main goal for me is to learn the 
inner-workings of the code most people take for granted. This will allow me to 
completely understand all of the code that I use in my projects.

# How do I use it?
All questions will be answered when you look at the lite.h header file

# Why is it called blib? 
The name blib is a combination of my first initial and 'lib' which is short
for library. Also it sounds silly and squishy.
